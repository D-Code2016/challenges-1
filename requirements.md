## Requirements 

How do you know what is needed to make a product successful? One of the ways development teams track this is through **Requirements**. 

Requirements are a set of criteria that a product (or a feature of a product) should have. There are lots of ways to describe requirements. Let's look at one method called User Stories:

A User Story is a way of describing a product's expected behavior. It sets up a pre-defined staring point from the perspective of a user. Then it describes some action taken by the user. Finally, it describes why the user wants this feature. Generally, these kinds of descriptions are written in a specific format like, "As a <ROLE>, I want <FEATURE> so that <REASON>". Here are some examples:

As a USER, 
I want to be able to UPLOAD PHOTOS 
so that I can share photos with friends and family

As a SITE ADMINISTRATOR,
I want to be able to APPROVE MEMBERS
so that I can make sure the site's members are not spam-bots.


**Challenge Details**
You're the Product Owner for a new mobile chat app called What's Kik?™. You want to add a notifications feature for the app for when the user's phone is locked or the app is not in focus. Create a requirement for this feature in the form of a user story. As a bonus, write a second user story for when the user has not given the What's Kik?™ app permission to send notifications.
